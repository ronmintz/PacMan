# PacMan
Moves PacMan up and back between screen boundaries with appropriate images.
With the structure of the PacMan program that we were given, after filling in the function checkPageBounds() and adding setInterval(), my program is accepted by Next Tech.  But PacMan goes slightly outside the boundaries of the screen if you look carefully, especially if you slow down the motion.  Although this degree of precision may not seem to matter for a cartoon exercise, precision is important for scientific and many other real-world applications.  In this repository, I present a restructured version which remedies this problem.  Before calling checkPageBounds, I update pos (+ or - 20) without copying it to img.style.left.  Then I call a modified version of checkPageBounds which returns both direction and pos in an array.  If pos has gone below zero, it is set to zero.  If pos has gone above pageWidth - imgWidth, it is set to pageWidth - imgWidth.  This adjusts pos to the screen boundary if it has gone outside before storing it into img.style.left.  We thus set PacMan at the screen boundary if the calculated pos has gone outside the boundary.  I have tested this solution at a lower speed (setInterval(Run, 500)) to be more visible and verified that PacMan stops and reverses direction exactly at the page boundary.
